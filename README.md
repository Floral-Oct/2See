# 2See
Swift 2019.

- The name of my app is called “2See”. 

2See contains a series of vision training exercises from Leo Angart’s book. 
You can find pictures, instructions and videos on how to perform these exerices. 
I used the Youtube API for the video feature, and SwiftyJSON, Alamofire. 
The app also directs you to Leo’s vision training website, which I used the UIWebView to redirect html links. 
2See also allows you to invite users using Firebase and Dynamic Links SDK, so you can share all these awesome exercises 
with your friends who wish to improve and protect their vision!
